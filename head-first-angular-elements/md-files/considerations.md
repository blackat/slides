## Conclusions

- polyfills do not always simulate the expected behavior
- `CSS` loading issues in the Shadow DOM
- `@Input`works from the root component
- packing is not really straightforward as the all implementation cycle
- size is bigger than expected, Ivy should solve the issue
- not possible to unregister a custom element
